# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects

Welcome to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects repository! This repository contains implementations of various NLP projects, each focusing on different aspects of natural language processing techniques and algorithms.

## Projects

### 1. Language AutoComplete Model
- Description: This project implements a Language AutoComplete Model that suggests word completions based on the input text.
- Example Notebook: [Here](Language%20AutoComplete%20Model/Example%20Notebook.ipynb)

### 2. Parts-of-Speech Tagging (POS) Hidden Markov Models and The Viterbi Algorithm
- Description: This project implements Parts-of-Speech (POS) tagging using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and the Viterbi Algorithm for sequence labeling.
- Example Notebook: [Here](Parts-of-Speech%20Tagging%20(POS)%20Hidden%20Markov%20Models%20and%20The%20Viterbi%20Algorithm/Example%20Notebook.ipynb)

### 3. Text AutoCorrection with Word Probabilities
- Description: This project implements a Text AutoCorrection system using word probabilities to suggest corrections for misspelled words.
- Example Notebook: [Here](TextAutoCorrection%20with%20Word%20Probabilities/Example%20Notebook.ipynb)

### 4. Named Entity Recognition with TensorFlow and LSTMs
- Description: This project implements a Text Named Entity Recognition Model using Tensorflow and LSTMs on a body of text.
- Example Notebook: [Here](Named%20Entity%20Recognition%20with%20TensorFlow%20and%20LSTMs/Example%20Notebook.ipynb)

## Usage
Each project directory contains an Example Notebook.ipynb file demonstrating how to use the code. Simply open the notebook in a Jupyter environment to explore the project and its functionality.

## Requirements
- Jupyter Notebook
- Other dependencies specific to each project (refer to each project's requirements.txt for details)

I have had a wonderful time learning the concepts above and implementing it in the `Natural Language Processing Specialization` by `DeepLearning.AI`, available [here](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/natural-language-processing-specialization/)
